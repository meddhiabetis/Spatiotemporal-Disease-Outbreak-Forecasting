# Project Plan: Spatial and Temporal Analysis of Disease Outbreaks

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze and model disease outbreaks using both spatial and temporal data. The goal is to create a robust model that can predict outbreaks based on various features, including climate variables, water management, waste management, and other relevant data.

## Steps and Timeline

### 1. Data Collection and Initial Exploration
- **Task**: Collect datasets and perform initial exploration.
- **Subtasks**:
  - Collect datasets related to disease outbreaks, climate variables, water management, and waste management.
  - Perform initial data exploration to understand the structure and distribution of the data.

- **Task**: Clean and preprocess the data.
- **Subtasks**:
  - Handle missing values and outliers.
  - Convert temperature data from Kelvin to Celsius.
  - Standardize and normalize features where necessary.
  - Create meaningful feature names for better interpretability.
  - Merge and align datasets based on spatial and temporal dimensions.
  - **Tips**:
    - Use interpolation for missing time series data.
    - Aggregate spatial data to a common resolution.
    - Use spatial joins to combine spatial datasets.
    - Consider temporal smoothing for time series data.
- **Timeline**: 2 weeks

### 3. Feature Engineering
- **Task**: Create new features that can improve model performance.
- **Subtasks**:
  - Create lag features for time series data to capture temporal dependencies.
  - Calculate spatial indices such as Moran's I and Geary's C to capture spatial autocorrelation.
